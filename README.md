# KRR_Project
Your project should have a clear and thorough README file that describes step by step what I will
need to do to run your project, anything I need to load, anything I need to type, and any expected output.
Also include in the documentation how things work, which will allow me to play around with things and
see what other outputs I might get.

3. Load all .krf files in the knowledge folder (located in the repository's home directory)
4. Start the RePlay code Django server by running "python manage.py runserver" from the
   django_stuff folder (located in the repository's home directory)
5. In a web browser, browse to "localhost:8000"
6. This is the main RePlay interface. Select three games from each of the text entry boxes
   and for each game, select one or more properties about the game that you like.
7. Select Go. The resulting page will show three game recommendations based on the
   games and attributes entered in the previous page. Submit feedback for each of these
   recommended games by selecting the frowny face (bad recommendation), neutral face
   (okay recommendation), or smiley face (good recommendation).
8. Select "Submit Feedback" to be redirected back to the original page. This feedback will
   be taken into consideration when making future recommendations.
